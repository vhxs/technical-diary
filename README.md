# Technical Diary

I read a lot about lots of things. I'd be nice to take some daily notes somewhere. I'm leaving this repository intentionally public so that others can see all the topics I explore, but not *so* public facing that I hyperlink to it from my website

Probably going to be much rougher than a blog. But that's okay, because good, public-facing writing isn't necessarily the goal here.
